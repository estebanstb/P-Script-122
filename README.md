## Description 
I did this project as part of my formation. The project needed to be made in 3 weeks with 3 periods of work per week.
1 period = 45 minutes, which makes it 2 hours and 15 minutes per week.

This project is linked to the PowerShell module of my formation, so my teacher asked me to create a technical specification document, submit it to him, if he thinks that the work is not too simple he'll valiate it and sign it for me to start working on it.
I went for a PC management project that i can launch to a PC connected on the same network.
